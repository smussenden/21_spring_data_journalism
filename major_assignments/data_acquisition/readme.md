# Data Acquisition Project

This project will give you some real-world experience in trying to get a useful dataset from a government agency – or trying to pry it out of the hands of its keepers, which may turn out to be a more appropriate description of the effort in some cases.

## Why we're seeking data

You’re helping us obtain data that could power future investigative work being done by students at the University of Maryland Philip Merrill College of Journalism (working for the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the college).

We're going to seek detailed records and data from state lottery agencies across the U.S., to try to answer, at scale, which members of the public are bearing the brunt of financing a system of state-run gambling that supplies a significant portion of the budget in nearly every state.  

This is fundamentally a story of economic inequality, one that's been hard to tell because lottery agencies are notoriously reticent to release data.  Their marketing based on their own analysis of their data: the median player is an upper-middle class person who plays the lottery a few times a year. And that's correct, but it's not *true*.

When researchers and journalists have been able to get their hands on data in select states to do their own analysis based on how much different groups spend on the lottery each year, a truer picture emerges.

The vast majority of total money spent on the lottery comes from a very small group of players.  The top 5 percent of players account for more than half of lottery sales. The top 20 percent account for nearly 80 percent of lottery sales.  There's evidence that lower-income people, people with less education and African-Americans are over-represented in these groups relative to population. [State Lotteries at the Turn of the Century:Report to the National Gambling Impact Study Commission1](https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10161/7548/lottrep.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)

We're going to request from these agencies data to help us examine these questions at scale.


## The data we're seeking

You will be assigned a state lottery agency and will put in a public records request to obtain the following information:
* The past five years of lottery sales data by retail location for all game types. [Florida example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GB2335u8s6fr2bJXo1vN0bRkWCLKyeLc/edit?rtpof=true)
* The past five years of winner claims data by retail location for all game types.
* Any surveys or studies of the lottery-playing public done by the agency or on behalf of the agency over the past 10 years, and any reports or other materials that use information from those surveys or studies. This should include any surveys/reports/other information about how much different demographic groups or market segments play the lottery -- if available -- both in terms of frequency and total/average spending. This could include marketing segmentation studies, marketing mix studies or any reports/surveys generated Ipsos Reid or similar public opinion research firms.

[Example in depth study from Florida](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oNzrX0b4nEWvZqJh4YLhKFg17dSRIUHb/view?usp=sharing)
* Any marketing and advertising plans, including detailed information about how the agency advertises on different platforms. [Example for Florida](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z_z4gzDWcpD6TKoQkzbuls53q-iddyAr/view?usp=sharing)
* Any marketing mailing lists (email and USPS) maintained by the agency.    

## Grading and Deadlines

This project is worth 10 percent of your total final grade.

Your grade does not depend on whether you successfully get the data we are requesting, though certainly I hope that happens.  

Your grade does depend on whether you display a solid, steady, and intelligent effort that takes advantage of your journalistic skills, your knowledge of the law and the application of the approaches we discuss in class.  

Your will demonstrate to me that you are making that effort by clearly and concisely discussing your successes and failures in the milestone memos you submit for review.

The grading breaks down this way.

* Interim status updates - 10 percent total
  * Week 3 update (Milestone 1) - 10 percent
    * Do web-research in preparation for sending a public records request to the agency.  Does any of the data we're seeking exist online? Are there aggregated records on the website that might hint at the existence of raw data that aren't stored online? If it's not available online, are their clues on the website that the information exists? Who at the agency should we send public records requests to?  You can make calls to the agency, but it's not required.
  * Week 4 update (Milestone 2) - 10 percent
    * Send in a public records request requesting the data, using a template and a letter approved by me.  You will use the information gathered for your previous update to sharpen your request. After you send the letter in, call to make sure someone got it.
    * Update your contact log with any information on outreach.  
  * Week 6 update (Milestone 3) - 10 percent
    * Contact your agency to check on the status of your request and respond to any questions from them about the nature of your request or payment or any other matters.  
    * Update your contact log with any information on outreach.
* Week 8 Final memo (Milestone 4) - 30 percent
    * In a memo of approximately 1000 words, you will describe your efforts in detail to obtain the requested data from your agency. You should cover the following points.
      * About the reporting: what did you learn in your efforts to gather as much information as possible about the data before submitting a request? How did this help you formulate a better request?
      * About the law: How did your use of the law factor into your efforts to obtain the data?  What legal points did the agency raise?  What legal points did you raise?
      * About the negotiation: Tell us about your contacts with the agency. Did officials put up barriers to access or accommodate you? Did they object to releasing the data in electronic form? What was the outcome?
      * Looking ahead: If you have not obtained the data, what steps are you planning to take next?  Have you followed up recently with your agency? What have they told you?
      * Lessons learned: What did you learn from this project that you might be able to apply to future reporting efforts and that would be useful for other students to know?  Did you learn anything about yourself? Your insights here are an important feature of the assignment.
* Week 9 Presentation (Lightning Talk) - 10 percent
     * In week 9, you will update the class verbally on two things in a presentation with a hard cap of one minute:
     * Tell us one thing you learned during the the data acquisition process, and the event that caused you to learn that lesson. What will help you do similar requests in the future?  
* Rest of semester follow-up - 10 percent
    * If you have not obtained all of your data and information by the time of the presentation, you should continue connecting with your agency in an attempt to do so.  
    * You will turn in an update at the end of the semester giving me the data and information, or detailing next steps.  


## Contact log

You will maintain a written log of your contacts as a Google spreadsheet.  This is an essential and vitally important part of this project. This log, which you will submit as part of your graded work on this assignment along with your final report, should include the following for each occasion that you reach or even attempt to reach someone for this project:  

* the person’s full name;
* their job title;
* the agency for which they works;
* the location of that agency;
* at least enough contact information so that you can find this person again later or so that someone else reading the log could find this person again (phone number, e-mail address or both);
* the date and time;
* and a brief summary of what transpired.  

Some of the people you deal with – say, the receptionists or assistants who first answer the phone – may not want to give you their names, but you can always try telling them that you like to keep a record of the people with whom you speak. Your thoroughness may be appreciated.  An inadequate log – especially one that does not provide enough information for someone reading the log to know precisely whom you contacted, how you contacted them, when you contacted them and what you discussed – may prevent you from getting a passing grade for this assignment.

## Request Letter

Do not send an official PIA request letter without getting it approved by me in advance.  When it's ready, I'll give you Howard Center letterhead to put it on for sending.

In most cases, you'll need to draft a public information act request letter to get the data, based on the laws of that state.  In order to draft a good request letter with a high chance of getting filled, you'll need to do a lot of reporting to learn if the data you seek exists, who keeps the data (the custodian), what it's called and what's in it, what might be exempt from disclosure and other information.  

You'll also need to familiarize with the law in the state and write a letter based on public records laws in the state.

When you do request the database, you will ask for a waiver of fees in any written request for the database. You will need to negotiate over this issue if the agency proposes to charge you for the data, and we will talk in class about how to do that. You are not required or expected to pay for this database yourself.

## Key things to keep in mind

Three key things to keep in mind:

* In talking with agencies, you should always identify yourself as a reporter for the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism, a non-profit investigative reporting unit based in Maryland.  If someone asks if you're a student, please say yes, but don't volunteer that you're a student or that this is for a class.  We are seeking information that could be used in a news story.
* Explain that you're looking to gather information about lottery customers and who plays, but don't give additional information without chatting with me first.  
* When requesting data for this project, you shouldn’t immediately volunteer why you’re requesting data or share details of the project.  But during negotiations for access to data, you may find it necessary to share some details, and that’s okay.
