# Data Analysis Project 02

## About the project

This project is designed to replicate the messy business of doing data-driven investigations in the real world.

Unlike the first data analysis project, where you reverse engineered an existing story, your goal is to find something newsworthy that others have not already reported in a novel data set that could be used as a foundation for future reporting.

Your team will start with a series of questions; acquire, load and clean necessary data; analyze data; and do contextual reporting and document review to develop a robust analysis process and make sense of findings; and produce a strong analysis memo and reporting plan that could be used, in the future, as the foundation for a story.

I'm posting details about the specific nature of our (in-process) project on ELMS. [ELMS link](https://umd.instructure.com/courses/1300031/pages/data-reporting-project-2-reporting-plan-specifics)
