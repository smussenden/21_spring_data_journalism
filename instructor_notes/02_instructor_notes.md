## Openers

[START RECORDING]
* I'm recording.
* Reminders to mute your microphone.  
* And unless you've sent me a note explaining that you don't want to keep your video on during class, I'd ask that you turn it on now.  I won't force you to do it, just a reminder that it helps me teach.  
* And also a reminder to keep the chat up, cause I'll be asking you questions.
